# Introduction
Airbnb is a leading online marketplace that connects homeowners with individuals seeking temporary accommodations. It operates in over 220 countries and regions, making it a global player in the hospitality industry.

Examining the factors influencing Airbnb characteristics, such as prices, is particularly interesting because these are shaped by a variety of factors like location, seasonality and local events. Understanding these influences can provide valuable insights to find the best deals for an apartment and reveal a broader impact of external factors on Airbnb accommodations. Our report will focus on [Airbnb data](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) from Berlin for the years 2023 and 2024.
